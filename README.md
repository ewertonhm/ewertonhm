## 👋 Hey, I'm Ewerton Marschalk

🎯 **DevOps & Observability Engineer** with a strong background in **cloud-native environments**, **infrastructure automation**, and **end-to-end monitoring** — currently focused on delivering high-impact observability solutions using **Datadog**.

With a foundation in **network systems**, **cloud support**, and **telecom operations**, I bridge the gap between development and operations through automation, data-driven insights, and solid engineering practices.

### 💻 Technologies I work with

- **Observability**: Datadog · Elastic Stack · Zabbix  
- **Programming**: Go · Python · Node.js · TypeScript · PHP · .NET  
- **CI/CD & Automation**: GitHub Actions · GitLab CI · Jenkins · Azure DevOps · Harness · Ansible · Puppet · CWMP  

🔍 I'm always looking for ways to improve system reliability, performance, and visibility — helping teams scale with confidence and clarity.
